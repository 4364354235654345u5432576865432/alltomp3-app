<!--

When you *report an issue*, PLEASE, indicate:
- the operating system you're using (Windows, macOS, Linux);
- the AllToMP3 version you're using;
- the exact URL or searched you entered into AllToMP3.

Just telling "it doesn't download from Spotify" doesn't help me AT ALL. Each operating system works differently, the code really depends on the version and the URL you are trying to download.

Be precise 🙏

-->

* My operating system is: [Windows/macOS/Debian/Ubuntu...];
* My AllToMP3 version is: [0.3.4/0.3.6/...];
